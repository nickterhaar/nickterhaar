### Hello there, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Dutch _**Software Developer**_ (student),
_**photography enthusiast**_ and I like my occasional _**coffee**_.

At the end of 2021 I made the decision to make a career change and to become a (Software) Developer.

I first started with a 10-week course "Introduction to Full Stack Web Development". After this course I did an internship as a web developer.

A year later I came to the conclusion that I wanted to learn more than just web development and decided to go back to school.

And here I am... a _**Software Development (Ad)**_ student at the _**Saxion University of Applied Sciences**_ in Enschede.

I'm currently looking for:
<br>
**- First Internship (September - 10 weeks).**
<br>
**- Second Internship (TBD - 10 weeks).**
