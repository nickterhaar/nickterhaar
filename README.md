Hello there, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Dutch Software Developer (student),
photography enthusiast and I like my occasional coffee.

At the end of 2021 I made the decision to make a career change and to become a (Software) Developer.

I first started with a 10-week course "Introduction to Full Stack Web Development". After this course I did an internship as a web developer.

A year later I came to the conclusion that I wanted to learn more than just web development and decided to go back to school.

And here I am... a Software Development (Ad) student at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences in Enschede.

I'm currently looking for:
<br>
**- First Internship (September - 10 weeks).**
<br>
**- Second Internship (TBD - 10 weeks).**

For more information about these internships,
please checkout this PDF (in dutch).
